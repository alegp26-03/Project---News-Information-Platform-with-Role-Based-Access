# Project---News-Information-Platform-with-Role-Based-Access
Developed a web application using Spring Boot and the Java programming language, designed to function as a dynamic news and content sharing platform. The core functionality revolved around allowing users to publish and share news articles, with a key feature being the implementation of a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system.
